# Mayomba Restaurant

**Author:** Keith Kahura

## Project Description

Mayomba Restaurant is a single-page responsive website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It features a polished and intuitive layout with a welcoming landing page, a dynamic menu loaded asynchronously from a local JSON file, and a contact form with validation. The project demonstrates good coding practices, including separation of data and code, event listeners, and asynchronous data fetching.

## Features

- Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
- Dynamic menu loaded from a local JSON file (`data/menu.json`) with realistic prices in KSH
- Cart functionality to accumulate orders with quantity controls and total price calculation
- Contact form with client-side validation and success feedback
- Single-page application with smooth navigation (no redirects)
- At least 3 event listeners: DOMContentLoaded, click (order buttons and cart controls), and submit (contact form)
- Polished styling with a hero image and intuitive layout

## How to Run

1. Serve the project directory using a local HTTP server. For example, using `http-server`:

   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 3000
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

3. Interact with the menu, add items to the cart, and use the contact form.

## Usage

- Browse the menu and add items to your cart.
- Adjust quantities or remove items in the cart.
- Fill out and submit the contact form.

## Commit Guidelines

- Make regular commits with clear, descriptive messages.
- Example commit messages:
  - "Initial commit: added project structure and basic layout"
  - "Implemented menu loading from local JSON file"
  - "Added cart functionality with quantity controls"
  - "Refactored code to separate data and UI logic"
  - "Added contact form validation and success message"
